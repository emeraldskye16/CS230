The client for the gaming room requested the development of a web-based application centered around a game where users view images and make guesses to solve puzzles. They sought a comprehensive explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of each operating system, along with recommendations that would best serve both the company and the end users.

The subsequent sections provide recommendations based on a comprehensive analysis of each area. They meticulously categorized the operating systems, evaluating their pros and cons with a focus on the end-user and the company. Cost considerations were paramount and repeatedly addressed concerning the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and the programming languages relevant to developers for each system.

The design document helped the team better understand the overall idea behind the project. It also provided time to understand the user's requirements, enabling the individual to make the proper changes to the code. Overall, it clarified what was being asked, guiding the future team in implementing the necessary modifications.

If the final project document were to be revised, the recommendation section would greatly benefit from increased detail. A more effectively included some vital information, yet they acknowledge that much more could have been added for clarity. For example, while addressing the built-in security features of Windows, there was an opportunity to delve deeper into the security measures embedded in the code. This additional context could have strengthened the client's understanding of the rationale behind recommending Windows. Moreover, a more comprehensive discussion of the extensive built-in features of Windows could have been valuable; however, due to time constraints and the intention to avoid overwhelming the client.

By seeking to understand the client’s needs for the project, the emphasis was on building the application with the client in mind. Developing a product without considering user satisfaction would be counterproductive. Recognizing the importance of client needs allows the developer and the team to tailor their code effectively to meet end-user requirements. This commitment fosters client satisfaction and encourages the continued development of additional products.

A key takeaway from this process is the importance of thoroughly understanding project requirements before implementing complex solutions. Misunderstandings can lead to errors and delays, resulting in dissatisfaction for the end user. Furthermore, supporting comprehensive documentation and conducting meticulous reviews of all work is essential, especially during the coding phase. As is well known, even a minor mistake, such as an incorrect uppercase letter, can result in significant issues, increasing both the time and cost for developers and end users—an outcome that is never desired.
